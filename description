<h3><strong>Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence</strong><br>
</h3>
<p>The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ (CSTE) Indicator 7 definition was used (see below for codes), except both ED and inpatient regular expressions take an “any mention” approach and scan all diagnosis codes included in discharge; the CSTE’s inpatient definition typically only scans the primary diagnosis code.<br>

F12.1–F12.9: Cannabis-related disorders<br>

<h3><strong>Inpatient Hospitalizations</strong><br>
</h3>
<p>Also see <strong>Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence</strong> and <strong>Infectious Disease</strong>, which are indicators in both ED and inpatient data.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</strong><br>
Both codes must be present for an inpatient hospitalization to be counted. Also note that neonates are group by their year of BIRTH, not discharge (like all other patients). For example, an infant born with NAS at the end of 2019, but discharged in the first quarter of 2020, will be included in the 2019 count. Thus inpatient data from the first quarter of the year following the final was pulled to allow for those babies discharged later.</p>
<p>P96.1: Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction AND<br>
Z38: Liveborn infant according to place of birth and type of delivery<br>
