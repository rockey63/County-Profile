Definitions from ICD-10-CM Data
Emergency Department Nonfatal Overdoses
Emergency department (ED) nonfatal overdoses are drug overdoses that present in the ED, defined by any mention of those categorized codes in the discharge paperwork, and survive the overdose event. See below for diagnosis codes.  For T36.9, T37.9, T39.9, T41.4, T42.7, T43.9, T45.9, T47.9, and T49.9, a 5th character of the following—and for all other codes a 6th character of the following—is required:
1: Accidental (unintentional)
2: Intentional self-harm
3: Assault or
4: Undetermined intent.
Note: 5th or 6th characters of “5” (denoting adverse effect) or “6” (denoting underdosing) are excluded from overdose-related counts.
If present, a 7th character of “A” is required, indicating an initial encounter for active treatment.

Substance Use Disorder Diagnosis
This indicator is meant to capture ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations with a substance use disorder diagnosis (not necessarily the initial diagnosis—any time the code is used for billing) in any diagnosis field. Note that alcohol related disorders, nicotine dependence, and inhalant related disorders are excluded. ED or inpatient hospitalization records are scanned for the following ICD-10-CM codes:
Any Opioid
F11: Opioid related disorders
F12: Cannabis related disorders
F13: Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic related disorders
F14: Cocaine related disorders
F15: Other stimulant related disorders
F16: Hallucinogen related disorders and
F19: Other psychoactive substance related disorders
Infectious Disease

B15.0: Hepatitis A with hepatic coma and
B15.9: Hepatitis A without hepatic coma
Hepatitis C
B17.10: Acute hepatitis C without hepatic coma
B17.11: Acute hepatitis C with hepatic coma
B18.2: Chronic viral hepatitis C
B19.20: Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma
B19.21: Unspecified viral hepatitis C with hepatic coma and
Z22.52: Carrier of viral hepatitis C
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Disease

Hepatitis A Comorbid to Drug Use
Any ICD-10-CM code found in Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence AND one or more of the ICD-10-CM codes found in Hepatitis A.
Hepatitis C Comorbid to Drug Use 
Any ICD-10-CM code found in Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence AND one or more of the ICD-10-CM codes found in Hepatitis C.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Disease Comorbid to Drug Use 
Any ICD-10-CM code found in Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence AND one or more of the ICD-10-CM codes found in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Disease.
Endocarditis Comorbid to Drug Use
Any ICD-10-CM code found in Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence AND one or more of the ICD-10-CM codes found in Endocarditis.
Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence
The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ (CSTE) Indicator 7 definition was used (see below for codes), except both ED and inpatient regular expressions take an “any mention” approach and scan all diagnosis codes included in discharge; the CSTE’s inpatient definition typically only scans the primary diagnosis code. 
F11.1–F11.9: Opioid-related disorders
F12.1–F12.9: Cannabis-related disorders
F13.1–F13.9: Sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic related disorders
F14.1–F14.9: Cocaine-related disorders
F15.1–15.9: Other stimulant-related disorders
F16.1–F16.9: Hallucinogen-related disorders
F19.1–F19.9: Other psychoactive substance-related disorders
O99.32: Drug use complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium
P04.4: Newborn suspected to be affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction
P96.1: Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction
T40.0–T40.9: Poisoning by narcotics and hallucinogens
T42.3: Poisoning by barbiturates
T42.4: Poisoning by benzodiazepines
T42.6: Poisoning by other antiepileptic and sedative-hypnotic drugs
T42.7: Poisoning by unspecified antiepileptic and sedative-hypnotic drugs and
T43.6: Poisoning by psychostimulants
For all T codes, adverse effects, underdosing, and encounters due to sequela are excluded.
Inpatient Hospitalizations
Also see Drug(s) with Potential for Abuse and Dependence and Infectious Disease, which are indicators in both ED and inpatient data.
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
Both codes must be present for an inpatient hospitalization to be counted. Also note that neonates are group by their year of BIRTH, not discharge (unlike the other ED and inpatient indicators). For example, an infant born with NAS at the end of 2019, but discharged in the first quarter of 2020, will be included in the 2019 count. Thus, if available, inpatient data from the first quarter of the year following the final was pulled to allow for those babies discharged later.
P96.1: Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction AND
Z38: Liveborn infant according to place of birth and type of delivery
